## Installation

To install this application, clone the code into your terminal for the respective repository. Then, install npm by entering the command `npm init` into the terminal. Finally, the program can then be run by entering Get, Post, Put, and Delete requests in Insomnia.

To launch the MySQL command-line client, enter the flowing command in a Command Prompt window: `mysql -u root -p `. The `-p`option is needed only if a root password is defined for MySQL. Enter the password when prompted.

2. In the terminal, type `npm start` to start the program.
3. Open Insomnia and enter Get, Post, Put, and Delete requests.
